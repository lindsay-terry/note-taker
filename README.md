## Description
This project is a note-taker, chore-keep-tracker, and achievement-cross-offer.  Simply   click "Get Started" to get started taking  notes and keeping track of your to-dos.  Clicking get started navigates the user away from the landing page and brings them to the page where they can keep track of notes .  Filling in the Note Title and Note Text fields with your own information about the notes will provide options to save the note or clear the form to start over.  Hitting save note moves your note instantly over to the lefthand column on the screen, and you can enter as many notes as you'd like.  If you'd like to revisit and already written note, click on the title of the note and it will pop up in the main section of the screen.  From here you can either click on other notes to view them, choose to write a new note by clicking the button that appears in the righthand corner of the screen, continue to view the same note, or click the little red garbage can icon to delete any notes in the lefthand side of the screen, including the selected note.  The note will instantly be deleted and you can move on with the rest of your to-do list.
